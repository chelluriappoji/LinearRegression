# Project Name
> Multiple Linear Regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes (BoomBikes)


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
   model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
   It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
   They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations
   
* [Technologies Used]
  Python with multiple libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, Sklearn, Statsmodels
  
* [Conclusions]
  bikes demand - It depend on the different variables like year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  Multi Linear Regression for Bike Sharing company
  
- What is the background of your project?
  Python with Linear Regression model.
  
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
  The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. Solve the problem with to find the demand levels and meet the customer expectations.
